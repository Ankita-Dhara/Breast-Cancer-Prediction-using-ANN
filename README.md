# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-ANN (Ongoing Project)
This repository contains two files. The csv file (breast_cancer.csv) is the database use in this project.The database contains data of patients with malignant or benign tumor and with other require data.
With the help of an artificial neural network model we are predicting wheather a patient with the above data has a malignant or benign tumor.
The packages reqire are pandas,numpy,sklearn,tensorflow. The code for the .csv file upload, the artificial neural network model and predefined input value is in the python file (BCP_ANN.py)
